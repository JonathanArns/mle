However, the field-effect transistor is approaching some physical limits to further miniaturization, and the associated rising costs and reduced return on investment appear to be slowing the pace of development. Far from signaling an end to progress, this gradual "end of Moore's law" will open a new era in information technology as the focus of research and development shifts from miniaturization of long-established technologies to the coordinated introduction of new devices, new integration technologies, and new architectures for computing.},

The material is written by leading American and European researchers, and each volume may be used independently.   Volume A  covers models of computation, complexity theory, data structures, and efficient computation in many recognized subdisciplines of theoretical computer science.  Volume B  presents a choice of material on the theory of automata and rewriting systems, the foundations of modem programming languages, logics for program specification and verification, and several chapters on the theoretic modeling of advanced information processing. The organization of each volume reflects the development of theoretical computer science from its classical roots to the modem theoretical approaches in parallel and distributed computing. Extensive bibliographies, a subject index, and list of contributors are included in each volume.}

abstract = {Boolean Satisfiability is probably the most studied of combinatorial optimization/search problems. Significant effort has been devoted to trying to provide practical solutions to this problem for problem instances encountered in a range of applications in Electronic Design Automation (EDA), as well as in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This study has culminated in the development of several SAT packages, both proprietary and in the public domain (e.g. GRASP, SATO) which find significant use in both research and industry. Most existing complete solvers are variants of the Davis-Putnam (DP) search algorithm. In this paper we describe the development of a new complete solver, Chaff, which achieves significant performance gains through careful engineering of all aspects of the search - especially a particularly efficient implementation of Boolean constraint propagation (BCP) and a novel low overhead decision strategy. Chaff has been able to obtain one to two orders of magnitude performance improvement on difficult SAT benchmarks in comparison with other solvers (DP or otherwise), including GRASP and SATO.},

  abstract={Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers have been the subject of remarkable improvements since the mid 90s. One of the main reasons for these improvements has been the wide range of practical applications of SAT. Indeed, examples of modern applications of SAT range from termination analysis in term-rewrite systems to circuit-level prediction of crosstalk noise. The success of SAT solvers motivated many practical applications, but many practical applications have also provided the examples and the challenges that allowed the development of more efficient SAT solvers. This paper provides an overview of some of the most well-known applications of SAT and outlines several other successful applications of SAT. Moreover, the improvements in SAT solvers motivated the development of new algorithms for strategic extensions of SAT. As a result, the paper also provides a brief survey of recent work on extensions of SAT, including pseudo-Boolean constraints, maximum satisfiability, model counting and quantified Boolean formulas.},

The outcome, today, is manifested in dozens of high performance and relatively scalable SAT solvers. The significant success of SAT solving technology, specially on practical problem instances, is credited to the aggregation of different SAT enhancements. In this paper, we revisit the organization of modern conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) solvers, focusing on the principal techniques that have contributed to their impressive performance. We also examine the interaction between input instances and SAT algorithms to better understand the factors that contribute to the difficulty of SAT benchmarks. At the end, the paper empirically evaluates different SAT techniques on a comprehensive suite of benchmarks taken from a range of representative applications. The diversity of our benchmarks enables us to make fair conclusions on the relation between SAT algorithms and SAT instances.",

NP-complete decision problems are pervasive in all areas of computing, with literally thousands of well-known examples. Nevertheless, SAT solvers routinely challenge the problem's intractability by solving propositional formulas with millions of variables, many representing the translation from some other NP-complete or NP-hard problem. The practical effectiveness of SAT solvers has motivated their use as oracles for NP, enabling new algorithms that solve an ever-increasing range of hard computational problems. This paper provides a brief overview of this ongoing effort, summarizing some of the recent past and present main successes, and highlighting directions for future research.",
